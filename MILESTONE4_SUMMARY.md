- **Status**: ✅ Completed successfully
- **Result**: 29,120 products updated with department foreign keys

### **5. Update existing products API to include department information** ✅
- **Method**: Updated all API endpoints to include department data
- **Status**: ✅ Completed successfully
- **Result**: All endpoints now return department information

## 🗄️ **Database Changes**

### **New Tables Created**
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

### **Products Table Updated**
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN department_id INTEGER;
CREATE INDEX idx_products_department_id ON products(department_id);
```

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Product Name",
  "category": "Category",
  "brand": "Brand",
  "retail_price": 49.99,
