Milestone 4: Refactor Departments Table Migration Script

This script performs the database refactoring to move departments into a separate table
with proper foreign key relationships as specified in Milestone 4.

Steps:
1. Create a new departments table
2. Extract unique department names from products data
3. Populate the departments table with unique departments
4. Update the products table to reference departments via foreign key
5. Update existing products API to include department information
